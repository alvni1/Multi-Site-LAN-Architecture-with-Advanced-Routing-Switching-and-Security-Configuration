Designed and implemented a secure, scalable 3-tier LAN architecture connecting two office sites via a core layer, with R1 providing redundant internet access and serving as the networkâ€™s gateway and DHCP server. Configured Layer 2 and Layer 3 protocols including EtherChannel (PAgP/LACP), VTPv2, Rapid PVST+, HSRPv2, and OSPF (point-to-point) for optimized network performance, redundancy, and convergence. Deployed comprehensive network services including DHCP relay, DNS, NTP, SNMP, Syslog, SSH with ACLs, and NAT (static and PAT), ensuring centralized management, secure remote access, and internet connectivity. Implemented Layer 2 security controls such as Port Security, DHCP Snooping, and Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI), along with extended ACLs to control inter-office traffic and enforce access policies.
Configured a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) and Lightweight Access Points (LWAPs) with WPA2/AES encryption, enabling secure wireless connectivity and dynamic AP association.
